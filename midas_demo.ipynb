    "Next, we will generate some missingness. Very few columns in the actual data contain missing values, so we want to change this. For the variance tests, we spiked in 100 values to test against. For this example, let's make this number a little larger - 5000 values in each column. We will then replace the sampled indices with np.nan...our missing value. While it is possible to sample 5000 values directly, we often used masks as they allow us to return later and inspect the error. While this notebook won't be reproducing that process, feel free to adapt the code examples. We also save one of the removed values for the end."

    "Next, we concat the dataset back into one dataframe, and apply a minmax scaler. Minmax maps the range of all values to between 0 and 1 - useful for keeping the gradients flowing through the neural network small. Smaller numbers means weight updates will have gradual change, not destructive oscillation. In some cases, having the minimum value equal to 0 does have some drawbacks, though. If your low-end values are giving you strange results, consider trying a different scaling scheme.\n",

Instead, we have to be sure to pass in numeric values or else we'll have errors returned."

For this test, we will build a small 3 layer network for demonstration. All the hyperparameters are specified in the instantiation, and all the data is passed into the .build_model() method.

    "First, we want to make sure our model is building an accurate representation of the data. The first method we should call is .overimpute(). This method removes a set proportion of known values, and allows us to explore the evolution of the model's output. It is a way of estimating the ideal model complexity which will give us the most accurate imputations - the values become our out-of-sample data. We do not want to do this during the actual run, though. Not only does a train-test split setup overestimate ideal model complexity in autoencoders, but it denies the model anywhere between 10% and 30% of existing data. At higher levels of missingness, this additional data could be crucial.\n",
